# UFOs

Ignore the first js folder that is an old folder and not relavent anymore.

Please see Static folder for complete code and data used.

In this project we created a website which displayed data from which we gathered on UFO sightings. We have a list of possible sightings which have been documented. I created a filter on the side to help the user filter through various different sights which can help find a close sighting near you or around your city, state, etc.
